Charged-lepton invariants (ledger-locked, parameter-free).

- I_1 = 4  (Y_R^2, universal)
- I_2 = 9/76  (w_L Â· T(T+1), universal; T=1/2, w_L=3/19)

Species separation comes from the ledger's 8-beat chiral square wave. In the
closed-form treatment we do not inject a truncated odd-harmonic set here; the
odd-harmonic contribution is resummed in the mass engine using the rung phase.

For backward-compatibility, a toggle allows inclusion of the first few odd
harmonics. By default we exclude them to avoid double counting when the
closed-form chiral term is enabled in the mass solver.
